# SIT.ExcelAnalytics
My first Github project!

An Excel addin for simple financial analytic UDFs written in F#. Not much here yet and anything that is here is just experimenting.

As this is my first open source, github project you'll see way too many insignificant commits, not enough testing and generally poor coding. Be gracious please! :)
